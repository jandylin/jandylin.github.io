I joined [Cambridge CBL](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org){:target="_blank"} in October 2022 as a PhD student participating in the Cambridge — Tübingen PhD Fellowships in Machine Learning program and the [ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc){:target="_blank"}.
My research focuses on Bayesian machine learning, particularly Gaussian processes, variational inference and neural compression. My academic supervisors are [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org){:target="_blank"} (University of Cambridge, Professor) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs){:target="_blank"} (Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Director), and my studies and research are funded by the [Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholars Programme](https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}.
Before starting my PhD, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Autonomous Systems from [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp){:target="_blank"} in Germany, where I worked with [Stefan Roth](https://www.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/visual_inference/people_vi/stefan_roth.en.jsp){:target="_blank"}, [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters){:target="_blank"} and [Kristian Kersting](https://ml-research.github.io/people/kkersting/){:target="_blank"} and received the [Deutschlandstipendium](https://www.deutschlandstipendium.de/deutschlandstipendium/de/services/english/english_node.html){:target="_blank"}.
I also attended the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca){:target="_blank"}, [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu){:target="_blank"} and [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en){:target="_blank"} through student exchange programs and summer sessions, and visited [Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu){:target="_blank"} as part of Fulbright’s [Leaders in Entrepreneurship](https://www.fulbright.de/programs-for-germans/studierende-und-graduierte/leaders-in-entrepreneurship){:target="_blank"} program.
