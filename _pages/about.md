I am currently a Research Scientist in the [Adaptive Experimentation](https://ax.dev){:target="_blank"} team at [Meta](https://www.meta.com){:target="_blank"}, where we develop sample-efficient methods for block-box optimization problems.
My research focuses on hyperparameter tuning and transfer for deep learning, including learning curve prediction and neural scaling laws.
Previously, I completed my PhD in the [Computational and Biological Learning Lab](https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked on probabilistic machine learning under the supervision of [José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org){:target="_blank"}.
During my PhD, I was funded by the [Harding Distinguished Postgraduate Scholars Programme](https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and affiliated with the [Empirical Inference](https://is.mpg.de/ei){:target="_blank"} department at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}.
Before starting my PhD, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Autonomous Systems from [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp){:target="_blank"} in Germany, where I worked with [Stefan Roth](https://www.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/visual_inference/people_vi/stefan_roth.en.jsp){:target="_blank"}, [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters){:target="_blank"} and [Kristian Kersting](https://ml-research.github.io/people/kkersting/){:target="_blank"}.
I also attended [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca){:target="_blank"}, [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu){:target="_blank"} and [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en){:target="_blank"} as a visiting student, and participated in Fulbright’s [Leaders in Entrepreneurship](https://fulbright.de/stipendien/programm/leaders-in-entrepreneurship-sommerstudienprogramm-uni-und-fh){:target="_blank"} program.
